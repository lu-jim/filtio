Transcript – Industry Expert #2

Kfund: Thanks for taking the time. How do you view Embat compared to other players in the treasury SaaS space?

Expert: They’ve built strong momentum in Spain, but regionally they’re still a small player. Agicap and Trovata have more brand recognition across Europe. Embat needs to prove it can expand beyond its home market.

Kfund: What do you think are their main strengths?

Expert: Product usability, no doubt. CFOs like the dashboards. And they’ve been good at listening to customers and iterating quickly. That’s something legacy systems can’t match.

Kfund: And their weaknesses?

Expert: Depth and credibility. Forecasting is basic, multi-entity functionality is patchy, and compliance in larger markets like Germany or the UK is a question mark. Also, their sales narrative feels a bit too polished compared to where the product actually is.

Kfund: Do you believe their claim of onboarding within two weeks?

Expert: For very simple clients, maybe. But realistically, most mid-sized companies will take a month or more. I’ve heard of cases where it stretched to six weeks. That’s not bad, but it’s not what they pitch.

Kfund: How do you assess the team’s ability to scale internationally?

Expert: The founders are ambitious, but they’re still relatively inexperienced in running a pan-European go-to-market. They’ll need senior hires — particularly in enterprise sales and regulatory affairs — if they want to break out of the Iberian market.

Kfund: From an investor perspective, what red flags would you watch for?

Expert: High churn among early customers, over-promising on the roadmap, and a CAC/LTV ratio that doesn’t improve as they scale. Fintech history is full of great-looking dashboards that never turned into sustainable businesses.

Kfund: Do you think the market is large enough to support a player like Embat?

Expert: Absolutely — the mid-market treasury opportunity in Europe is significant. The question is whether Embat becomes the category winner or just another regional player.
